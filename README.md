# Resilira – A Game of Resilience and Strength

**Resilira** is a game about overcoming self-doubt and pushing through inner negativity. You take control of a small but powerful force of determination, facing falling obstacles that represent negative self-talk. Each challenge reflects real struggles—self-doubt, fear, and uncertainty.

Will you dodge these thoughts, or will you push through and break them with resilience?

## Features
- **Simple but meaningful gameplay** – Move, react, and decide how to handle each challenge.
- **A growing challenge** – The more you push forward, the harder it gets.
- **An experience about persistence** – No enemies, no timers—just you versus your thoughts.
- **A minimalist yet deep concept** – A reminder that inner strength is built over time.

## How to Play
- Move left and right to avoid negative thoughts.
- If your determination is strong enough, you can break through them.
- Keep going and see how far you can push yourself.
